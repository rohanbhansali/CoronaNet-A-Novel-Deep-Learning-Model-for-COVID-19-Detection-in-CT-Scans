# Effect of the Laplace Operator on the Performance of CoronaNet for COVID-19 Detection
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the cause of a global pandemic that is affecting millions of people around the world. Inadequate testing resources have resulted in several people going undiagnosed and consequently untreated. However, using computerized tomography (CT) scans for diagnosis is an alternative to bypass this limitation. In this paper, we describe CoronaNet, a deep convolutional neural network that can recognize if a patient has COVID-19 from images of CT scans with 91% accuracy. We hope this algorithm can be incorporated into hospitals around the world to assist in coronavirus mitigation efforts. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Laplace Operator in enhancing the performance of CoronaNet.
